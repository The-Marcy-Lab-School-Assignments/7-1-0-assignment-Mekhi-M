# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer

First, you must create a Context object. Using the `createContext()` function from the React library, you can make a context and return it as a component.

Next you need to render the context provider. Using the returned context component, it can be used to wrap other components and be passed values.

Lastly, you can use the values inside of the context. With `useContext` you can copy the Context object and its properties into the component that actually needs the data.
